# The `WaveBuilder` Class

Even though internally **WaveManipp** uses the C functions `std::malloc`, `std::calloc`, and `std::realloc` for memory allocation and reallocation, it may still be suboptimal when merging a large number of `Wave` objects. The better solution is to use the `WaveBuilder` class, which stores pointers to the actual `Wave` objects. Nonetheless, when using this class, it is crucial that the consituent objects be not destroyed before creating the final `Wave` object using the `toWave()` method.
